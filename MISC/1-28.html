      <p>I think of a website as a plaintext document, one which is uniform at its core. The website can always be stripped down to view its source code, or it can be rendered and revealed in a browser, on a stage.</text>

      <p>But a document's individual characters hold varying meaning depending on their context. '!' or Bang as it's known in Computer Science, finds itself used only in the comments of an HTML document. In the logic of code, such a symbol negates a boolean expression, and yet in HTML it negates the visibility of other charactersâ€”ones which may, otherwise, be crucial to a page's layout.</text>

    <div class="site">
      <p>I wonder then, how a website might rely on the comments embedded in its HTML, those lines which are unresponsive or unfashionable. Or further, the comments in its CSS, of which a single line may have an influence which cascades down an entire document, with the possibility of altering even lines of HTML which have been turned into comments.</text>

      <p>When I read that a website is 'inhabited,' I think not of their operation or ownership, but of the way that a website may inhabit itself through rules assigned to its code which guarantee the maintenance of its style.</text>

      <p>Or I think of Jekyll, the blogging framework which auto-generates pages for each new post, allowing the user to style pages before they are published, without having to construct their site in a traditional sense. The user, in essence, is asked only to create a markdown file, which is the opposite of code. The rest falls into the framework, and a blog is created.

      <p>This doesn't, however, make me nostalgic for a 'hand-made web.' I'm inclined to say that products like Jekyll make the web more accessible, but I think the web is quite accessible as it stands, and as it has stood. Engineers with no design experience made early websites which looked like 'angry fruit salad' and now, just about anyone can throw together a page with a paragraph tag or two. If Jekyll eases the burden of maintaining a site for those with some technological know-how, then I'm happy to have it. On the surface, it all looks the same, anyways.</p>
