      <p>Recently, GitHub has been recommending to me lots of APIs designed to scrape content and data from Instagram. As a curious person, I test ran several to see what the buzz is about. They were underwhelming (without necessary analysis or visualization), but what I still wonder about is the ability to track a user's growth on any given social platform—specifically on one which makes public a user's follower count. How are we to track growth of followers, then, if all we can see is the present? This growth assumes that rarely does a user lose a significant portion of their followers, save for in the wake of being 'cancelled' or the like.</p>

      <p>I am not someone who follows celebrities or public figures on social media, but I've begun following two politicians because, frankly, they're putting out good content. They both—Sanders and Warren—have decent followings, but their counts pale in comparison to Obama, the first president of the internet age. His following is one I would love to have tracked, but I suppose that data does not exist properly. Data which accumulates in the way that a follower count does, whether it augments or wanes, is constantly running an endless race, speeding up or slowing down towards an unforeseeable finish line.</p>

      <p>From my seventh floor window I can see a gas station which glows red and green, reflecting its prices off of the puddles accumulating in the broken cement which encircles it. For the entirety of the fall semester, I religiously recorded the fluctuations in prices, checking the sign multiple times daily as I watched West Rock fade in and out of view behind low clouds. I do not care about these numbers (I do not even know how to drive) but I felt—and still do feel—a sort of responsibility to them. Few have such a lucky view, and so the task of recording falls to me. Maybe I will leave a note for whomever will inhabit this room after me, informing them of this task which I will pass down onto them. In a way, I suppose, we will cohabitate in this space long after I move out.</p>
